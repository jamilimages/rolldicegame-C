# rolldicegame-C
A roll dice game created in C


# What I've learned
- Using Dev-C++ to create the C program
- the use of the 'time.h' library to randomly generate the integer for user input
- I used a for loop to calculate the 'counttime' variable based on user input
- using the 'rand' function to calculate the number of sides of a dice = totaling 6 sides
- If statement - if the countTime is equal to 0 then exit the program.

# Example of the game
